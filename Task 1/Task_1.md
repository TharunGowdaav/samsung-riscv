*RISC-V Programming - Task 1*
\n
This repository documents my progress in the RISC-V Talent Development Program by Samsung Semiconductor India Research (SSIR) and VLSI System Design (VSD).

*Lab Progress*
*1. Program Development*

  a. C program development in text editor
  b. Program to calculate sum of numbers 1 to N
  c.Terminal compilation process using gedit and gcc
  d. File structure showing source files (sum1ton.c)

*2. Program Execution*

Compilation command: gcc sum1ton.c
Execution command: ./a.out
Output: "Sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is 5050"

*3. Assembly Analysis*

  1. Generated RISC-V assembly code
  2. Memory addresses and corresponding instructions
  3. Register allocation and operations

*Environment Details:*

OS: Linux (VirtualBox VM)
Compiler: GCC
Tools: RISC-V GNU Toolchain
Editor: VSCode/Gedit
